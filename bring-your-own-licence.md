# Bring your own GitHub Licence
 
## Introduction
 
In the current digital environment, safeguarding our code and development practices is crucial. In this scenario, we’ll focus on our GitHub organization as we implement advanced security practices to protect our projects and sensitive data. To fully utilize these security features, a GitHub Enterprise license is necessary. This lab will provide you with the steps needed to strengthen our organization’s security and maximize the benefits of GitHub's advanced capabilities.
 
## Forking the GitHub repositories

In this step you will fork the github repositories that will used in this lab.
1. Visit the GitHub login URL i.e https://github.com/login
1. Login in GitHub using your credentials.
1. Copy and paste https://github.com/orgs/ghas-bootcamp-resources/repositories URL in the browser to visit the list of repositories that will be used in this lab.
1. Click on **java-app** repository and then click on **Fork**.
1. Under owner select your organisation and then unselect the checkbox against **Copy the main branch only** and click on Fork.
    >**Note:** Repeat step 4 and 5 for all remaining repositories.

>Important: Wherever you encounter the "githubxxx" organization in the instructions, substitute it with your enterprise organization and perform the lab.

Now you can use your own GitHub licence and your own production environment to practice these security measures.
