1. Next, to get the authentication code, sign in to Outlook through opening a new tab with the **GitHub** credentials that were copied over to Notepad in the previous step. After logging into Outlook, locate the most recent email that contains the verification code, and then select **Verify** to return to the login screen.

   ```
   https://outlook.office365.com/mail/
   ```

   >**Note:** The email containing the verification code can sometimes creep into the archive/spam folders within your Outlook.
