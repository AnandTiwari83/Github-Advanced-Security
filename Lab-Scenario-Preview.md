# Lab Scenario Preview: GitHub Advanced Security 

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will leverage GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) to bolster the security posture of your GitHub repositories. Through a series of tasks, you'll explore various features and functionalities aimed at identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities within your codebase. The lab begins by enabling GitHub Secret Scanning for your organization, implementing push protection, creating custom secret patterns, and understanding the scanning results. By simulating the addition of GitHub Personal Access Tokens to repositories, you'll witness firsthand how secret scanning detects and blocks active secrets, underscoring the critical importance of securing sensitive information within your codebase.

Next, you'll delve into enhancing security within your GitHub repositories using Dependabot and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) features. This involves leveraging Dependabot to automatically identify and remediate vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies, thereby reducing the risk of potential exploits. Additionally, you'll explore SCA to analyze the software dependencies in your codebase, identifying any known security vulnerabilities or outdated versions that may pose a risk to your application. By integrating these features into your development workflow, you'll be able to proactively address security issues and maintain the integrity of your codebase.

As you progress through the lab, you'll scale out the adoption of GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS), focusing on strategic approaches to security. This includes creating internal documentation, aligning GHAS rollout strategies, and scaling code and secret scanning across your repositories. You'll explore the security overview dashboard provided by GHAS, gaining valuable insights into your organization's security posture and identifying areas for improvement. Additionally, you'll set up webhooks for integration with external reporting tools like SIEM, enabling seamless communication and incident response capabilities.

Finally, you'll connect your GitHub account to Microsoft Defender for Cloud (formerly Azure Defender), further enhancing security monitoring and threat detection capabilities. By leveraging the robust capabilities of Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you'll gain comprehensive visibility into potential security threats and vulnerabilities across your GitHub repositories.
