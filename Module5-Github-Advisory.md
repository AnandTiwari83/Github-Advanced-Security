# Module 03: GitHub Advisory Database

## Lab Scenario

## Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will perform:

- Task 1: GitHub Advisory Database

## Estimated Timing: 30 minutes

### Task 1: GitHub Advisory Database

The GitHub Advisory Database is a collection of security advisories that includes information about known vulnerabilities in software. It contains advisories from various sources, including those reported on GitHub and other vulnerability databases. This database helps developers stay informed about security issues in the open-source software they use, allowing them to take action to protect their projects


### About types of security advisories

**Types of vulnerabilities**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Enables attackers to execute arbitrary code on a remote machine.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Makes a service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Allows attackers to gain higher-level permissions than they should have.
- **SQL Injection:** Lets attackers execute malicious SQL queries to manipulate databases.
- **Path Traversal:** Enables attackers to access files and directories outside the intended directory.
- **Insecure Deserialization:** Allows attackers to manipulate serialized objects to execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious actions.

Each advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database is for a vulnerability in open source projects or for malicious open source software.

A vulnerability is a problem in a project's code that could be exploited to damage the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the project or other projects that use its code. Vulnerabilities vary in type, severity, and method of attack. Vulnerabilities in code are usually introduced by accident and fixed soon after they are discovered. You should update your code to use the fixed version of the dependency as soon as it is available.

In contrast, malicious software, or malware, is code that is intentionally designed to perform unwanted or harmful functions. The malware may target hardware, software, confidential data, or users of any application that uses the malware. You need to remove the malware from your project and find an alternative, more secure replacement for the dependency.
