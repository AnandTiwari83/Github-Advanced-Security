      git clone --single-branch --branch github-webhooks https://github.com/hookdeck/nodejs-webhook-server-example.git
      ```

1. Navigate to the root of the project and install the required dependencies by running the following commands:

      ```
      cd nodejs-webhook-server-example
      ```

      ```
      npm install
      ```

#### Task 3.3: Get the webhook URL

1. Install the hookdeck by running the following commands.

      ```
      scoop bucket add hookdeck https://github.com/hookdeck/scoop-hookdeck-cli.git
      ```
      ```
      scoop install hookdeck
      ```

1. To allow traffic on port 1337

      ```
      netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=1337 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=1337 connectaddress=127.0.0.1
      ```

1. To verify that the port is listening, you can use the following command:

      ```
      netstat -an | findstr "1337"
      ```
      
1. Once the setup process is complete, the next step is to use the CLI to generate a webhook URL that points to the running API application.

      ```
      hookdeck listen 1337
      ```

1. This command starts an interactive session where the CLI collects information about the endpoint you're about to create. Below are the questions and the answers you should supply to each question.

    | Question | Answer |
    | -- | -- |
    | **What source should you select?** | select **Create new source** |
    | **What should your new source label be?** | type the text **Github** |
    | **What path should the webhooks be forwarded to (i.e.: /webhooks)?** | type **/log-github-webhook** |
    | **What's the connection label (i.e.: My API)?** | type **My Github Response Server** |

1. With this information, the CLI will begin the process of generating the URL and once it's done, you will see the URL printed to the screen and the CLI indicating that it is ready to receive requests.
