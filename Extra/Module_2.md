## Why are we using PAT Tokens

In this lab, Personal Access Tokens (PATs) are used as example secrets to demonstrate how GitHub’s secret scanning and push protection features work. Here’s why PATs are chosen for this exercise:

1. **Common Sensitive Data**: PATs are a common type of sensitive data that developers often accidentally commit to repositories. They provide a clear example of the kind of secrets that secret scanning is designed to detect and protect against.

2. **Realistic Scenario**: Using PATs creates a realistic scenario. PATs are real credentials that can be used to access GitHub’s API and perform actions on behalf of the user. This makes them a tangible example of how secret scanning prevents unauthorized access.

3. **Demonstration of Detection**: By using PATs, you can easily show how secret scanning identifies sensitive information in the codebase. This demonstrates the effectiveness of GitHub's security features in detecting and alerting on potential security risks.

4. **Educational Purpose**: PATs are widely understood by developers, making it easier for them to grasp the concept and importance of secret scanning. The exercise involves generating PATs, which helps users learn how to manage and secure their own tokens and other secrets.

Overall, PATs serve as an illustrative example of secrets that GitHub’s security features aim to protect, enhancing the educational value of the lab.
